## About this site

This is a personal portfolio website I have built to showcase my work. It is still a work inprogess in terms of the content that needs to be added.

The site can be viewed at [Here](https://bryce-devs.com/).

This site was built using Next.js with Typescript to test how my Javascript knowledge would translate to a more strict typing language and to make use of static typing and features like interfaces, enums, and advanced type-checking.

Since Tailwind CSS is becoming a major player in the Frontend Development world I have also decided to utilize it here.

## Free Use

If you want to run this locally or make use of the code structure to build you own website feel free.

First, run the development server in your favourite code editor, I used Visual Studio Code. Make sure you have node.js downloaded, if you need help downloading node.js just google it and you will see how you can go about installing it on your local machine.

Once you have everything setup open up a terminal and try one of the below run commands. Note I was using Node.js here so NPM comes pre-installed therefore I would use the first one of the below.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

If you would like to host your website on Vercel go for it the below information might be helpful. Since I wanted to showcase my understanding of Git and Github I utilized the Github pages with a custom deploy method to work nicely with my export types and next.js.

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
